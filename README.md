# Homelab projects
Practical experience is invaluable for understanding the complexities of network security, digital forensics, and the tools that defend against cyber threats. This collection of homelab projects aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on expertise in cybersecurity. Through these projects, we seek to deepen our understanding of network analysis, packet capture, firewall configuration, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and digital forensics, all within a controlled, experimental environment.

## Project Description

The primary goal of these homelab projects is to provide hands-on approach to learning cybersecurity. We aim to explore various facets of network security and we believe that working and learning together allows each author to bring their unique skills and experiences to the table. we can share insights, challenge assumptions, and approach problems from different angles. for the projects we are mainly focusing on:

- **Network Analysis:** Understanding the complexities of network communication through network traffic analysis, vulnerability identification, and detection of malicious patterns.
- **Packet Capture:** Using tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets, giving us insight into the data flow within a network and identifying any suspicious activity.
- **Network Creation and Configuration:** Setting up and configuring networks to simulate real-world scenarios, including the establishment of secure communication channels and the implementation of network security measures.
- **Firewall Configuration:** Learning to configure and manage firewalls to protect networks from unauthorized access and potential threats.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Implementing and fine-tuning IDS to detect and respond to potential cyber attacks, ensuring the security and integrity of the network.
- **Digital Forensics:** Conducting forensic investigations to trace and analyze cyber incidents, preserving evidence for further analysis and legal proceedings.

### Demonstration Goals

The homelab projects are designed to demonstrate the following key objectives:

1. **Comprehensive Network Analysis:** Demonstrate the ability to analyze network traffic, identify vulnerabilities, and recognize patterns of malicious activity.
  
2. **Effective Packet Capture and Analysis:** Showcase the use of Wireshark for capturing and analyzing packets to understand network communications and detect anomalies.

3. **Secure Network Setup:** Illustrate the process of creating and configuring secure networks, including the implementation of encryption, VPNs, and secure protocols.

4. **Firewall Configuration and Management:** Display the skills required to configure and manage firewalls, ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed within the network.

5. **Intrusion Detection and Response:** Exhibit the implementation of an IDS, fine-tuning it to detect and respond to cyber threats effectively.

6. **Digital Forensics Investigation:** Present the steps involved in conducting a digital forensics investigation, including data recovery, evidence preservation, and analysis.

### Conclusion

These projects not only aim to build practical cybersecurity skills but also serve as a foundation for more advanced exploration in the field. By the end of these projects, we will have a solid understanding of how to protect, analyze, and defend against cyber threats in real-world scenarios.
