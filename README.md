Nmap and Wireshark Demonstration Project
# Project description
This project aims to demonstrate the use of nmap and Wireshark for network scanning and traffic capture. By setting up virtual instances of Kali Linux and Ubuntu using virtualbox. In the project we explored various basic functionalities such as port scanning, SSH setup, and secure file transfer using scp. Additionally, this project showcases the setup and configuration of a host-only network, enabling seamless interaction between the virtual machines. Additionally, we will compare and analyze the differences between TCP ACK and Xmas scans using Wireshark.
