# Network analysis with Nmap and Wireshark
Nmap and Wireshark Demonstration Project
# Project description
This project aims to demonstrate the use of nmap and Wireshark for network scanning and traffic capture. By setting up virtual instances of Kali Linux and Ubuntu using virtualbox. In the project we explored various basic functionalities such as port scanning, SSH setup, and secure file transfer using scp. Additionally, this project showcases the setup and configuration of a host-only network, enabling seamless interaction between the virtual machines. Additionally, we will compare and analyze the differences between TCP ACK and Xmas scans using Wireshark.
# Tools
- Virtualbox
- Wireshark 
- Nmap
- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu
- scp

# Demonstration Goals
- <b><u>Network Setup</u></b>: Show IP addresses of Ubuntu and Kali machines and their ability to ping each other.
- <b>SSH Login </b>: Demonstrate SSH login to Ubuntu VM from Kali VM and file transfer using scp.
- <b>nmap Scans </b>: Explain and show differences between TCP ACK scan and Xmas scan using Wireshark on Kali machine.
