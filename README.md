# Homelab projects
Practical experience is invaluable for understanding the complexities of network security, digital forensics, and the tools that defend against cyber threats. This collection of homelab projects aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on expertise in cybersecurity. Through these projects, we seek to deepen our understanding of network analysis, packet capture, firewall configuration, web application firewall configuration, and digital forensics, all within a controlled, experimental environment (Oracle VirtualBox).

## Project Description

The primary goal of these homelab projects is to provide hands-on approach to learning cybersecurity. We aim to explore various facets of network security and we believe that working and learning together allows each author to bring their unique skills and experiences to the table. we can share insights, challenge assumptions, and approach problems from different angles. for the projects we are mainly focusing on:

- **Network Analysis**
- **Packet Capture**
- **Network Creation and Configuration** 
- **Firewall Configuration** 
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** 
- **Digital Forensics**
  
The homelab projects are designed to demonstrate the following key objectives:

1. **Comprehensive Network Analysis:** Demonstrate the ability to analyze network traffic, identify vulnerabilities, and recognize patterns of malicious activity.
  
2. **Effective Packet Capture and Analysis:** Showcase the use of Wireshark for capturing and analyzing packets to understand network communications and detect anomalies.

3. **Secure Network Setup:** Illustrate the process of creating and configuring secure networks, including the implementation offirewalls and various security mechanisms.

4. **Firewall Configuration and Management:** Display the skills required to configure and manage firewalls, ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed within the network.

5. **Intrusion Detection and Response:** Exhibit the implementation of an IDS, fine-tuning it to detect and respond to cyber threats effectively.

6. **Digital Forensics Investigation:** Present the steps involved in conducting a digital forensics investigation, including data recovery, evidence preservation, and analysis.
